Repository of useful links for red teamers

Through my career I have collected a lot of useful links and articles
Years of changing devices has created the need for a central repository.
This is a work in progress so if you are visiting now, come back later lol. 

TODO: build out table of contents, organize links into useful categories,
      organize by hosttype needed to use, and potentially type of target?
